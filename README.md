# Project Name

Pretty Music Maker aims is to make producing music accessible and intuitive through a simple and easy to use UI. In essence, we are benchmarking this app but we want to give more fine tune control to the users. Our app will be click driven in which users click to set events on a timeline that would continuously loop over from start to finish. Our appâ€™s point of differentiation from the pre-existing counterparts are the ability to save music and share.
