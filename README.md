## Redux Frontend Blogging App

In this assignment I created a blogging app following the CRUD paradigm using the robust React+Redux framework.

This app communicates with an api endpoint where it stores and updates the blog tiles, displayed on the front end.

Extra credit was not attempted. 

Everything went smoothly. No major hiccups.
